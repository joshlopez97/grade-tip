# GRADETIP: Assignment sharing platform
##### Overview
GradeTip allows users to share assignments with other users anonymously. Users can leave comments on the work of others and start anonymous discussion threads. The production release of this GradeTip is not included in this release for security reasons. This version has been tweaked to be ran locally with other minor revisions. Once live, the site will be available to view at [GradeTip.com](https://gradetip.com).
##### Adding Assignments
Adding assignments has been made easy with a local database of course titles from almost every school in the United States. This database is used to facilitate autofill features, which can detect spelling mistakes and acronyms so users can easily find the courses and schools they're looking for. Assignment images and documents can be uploaded with corresponding course and school information to allow other users to find it easily. These uploads can be edited before being added to the GradeTip database. Users can also specify a preview window that will be viewable to users before they are granted access. Eventually, payment may be incorporated to grant this access to other users (so users can profit from their assignments).
##### Finding Assignments
Finding assignments is simple with an intuitive search engine that can narrow results by school, course, subject, document type, etc. There is also a universal search engine which can accurately determine the type of document a user is looking for with keywords.
##### Account Creation
Users are given randomly generated usernames to avoid leaking personal information. The usernames consist of adjectives followed by nouns (example: DeterminedGoose, AngryGrape). The nouns are mainly animals and types of foods.
##### Future Updates
As I create more updated versions of the site, I will try to commit some altered versions of these features here.
