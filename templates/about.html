          We created this platform for students to exchange study materials for their college courses.
          Preparing for college can be incredibly stressful and finding reliable study resources can be very expensive.
          GradeTip
          is designed to put all the control in the hands of students.

      <h3><i>No subscription needed</i></h3>
      <p>
        While this site is still under construction, the idea behind GradeTip is to allow students to sell documents to
        other students. Instead of making students to pay an expensive monthly subscription fee, GradeTip would be an open
        marketplace for students to literally profit off of the hard work they've done. We'd also cap the price to something
        under a dollar per download, to keep GradeTip as accessible as possible. All sales will have to comply
        with our <a href="/terms">Terms and Conditions</a>.
      </p>
